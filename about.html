            Hi there, my name is Andrew and I am a 24-year-old aspiring
            Front-End Web Developer. For the past two years I have focused my
            time on learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Two months ago I
            challenged myself to learn something programming related everyday,
            which has helped me to consistently add to my skill set. I have a
            passion for learning; it makes me feel like I’m growing as a person,
            anything else and I feel like I stagnate so I feel programming is a
            good fit for me as I will need to become a “Lifetime learner”.

          <p>
            I have been studying Front-end web development for the past two
            years. Early on in my studies I realized the importance of keeping
            up to date with new technologies and updates to current
            languages/frameworks. I think this is great for me as I love
            learning and adding to skillset on a daily basis. Im hungry to learn
            as much as I can using multiple online resources .

            I have worked in 8 different bars in 3 different countries over the

            gained a great understanding of dealing and working with people from
            every kind of background.
