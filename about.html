            I have had a huge interest in IT for the past number of years. In my
            spare time I have been learning Front-End Web Development through
            various resources online Free code camp, Team treehouse, stack
            overflow, medium and more.

          <p>
            I have been studying Front-end web development for the past two
            years. Early on in my studies I realized the importance of keeping
            up to date with new technologies and updates to current
            languages/frameworks. I think this is great for me as I love
            learning and adding to skillset on a daily basis. Im hungry to learn
            as much as I can using multiple online resources .

            I have worked in 8 different bars in 3 different countries over the
            past 5 years. This has been an incredibly valueable experience as I
            gained a great understanding of dealing and working with people from
            every kind of background.
